<h1>React-ToDo</h1>
<p>A simple React app with data saved in local storage.</p>
<p>You can edit, mark as done and delete tasks. There is also pagination.</p>
<p>The code has a lot of things wrapped in useMemo(), useCallback() and React.memo().</p>
<p>This avoids re-rendering when the state changes.</p>

<p>Thanks, and have a nice day!</p>
